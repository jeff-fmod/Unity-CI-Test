Would it be useful to have *.cs text diff=csharp in there?

Yea I think it makes sense. I've added it. Thank you!

Shouldn't line 17 be unityyamlmerge rather than unityamlmerge ?

@JorisVanEijden, Oh wow what a miss hehe. Well spotted! I've updated the gist accordingly. Thank you!

Might want to specify lfs for occlussion data. In my project, my OcclusionCullingData.asset file is 136MB for example which exceeds Github's 100MB limit for non lfs tracked files.

Typo on line 15, Unities should be Unity's.

@JosiahJack I've added both suggestions. Thank you!

Added glTF, an open standard (ISO/IEC) for exchanging files between 3d software and engine software.

The .glf is the binary format. The .gltf is the (readable) text format.

*.glf lfs-file
*.gltf lfs-file

guillempd commented on Feb 20, 2023
Shouldn't the binary format be .glb? At least when exporting with Blender it is so.

Nice catch. You are right.

Source: https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#file-extensions-and-media-types

I've updated the file accordingly.

Why is the merge being unset on line 17. Is that a typo?

@webbertakken

webbertakken commented on Feb 28, 2023
@AndyUrquijo I believe it was indeed a typo. I've updated it.

Some times TextMeshPro's font assets; <font_name>.asset can end up being too big.
Could a filter for assets inside a font/fonts folder be added?

Something like:

**/[Ff]ont*/**/*.asset lfs-file
(Ii'm not very versed on how the topic, so I don't know if any other attributes should be set)
